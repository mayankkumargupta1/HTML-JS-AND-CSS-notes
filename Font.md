we definitely need some property to edit font of our text.
we have a number of such properties:

### Font Family 

It changes the type of font is there on the web page like if i want to add my favorite font in the web page which is Poppins.

Here is what I can do:
```css
.selector {
	font-family: Poppins;
}
```

### Fallback 

fall backs are used when the initial font is not found. It is a safety measure.

```css
.selector {
	font-family: Impact, serif;
}
```
