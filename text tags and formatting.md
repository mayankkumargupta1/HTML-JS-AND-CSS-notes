#### *hr and br

the problem with paragraph is that it compresses all the text and tries it show every thing in one line. 

here is an example:
```html
<p>
	Line1
    Line2
    Line3
</p>
```

To solve this problem we nest hr and br tags to separate them with lines.

here are the examples:
```html
<p>
	Line1<br>
    Line2<br>
    Line3<br>
</p>
<p>
	Line1<hr>
    Line2<hr>
    Line3<hr>
</p>
```
