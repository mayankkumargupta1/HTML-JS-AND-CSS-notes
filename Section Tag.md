Section tag is used to divide the elements in separate groups to organize the html script .

```html 
<html>
	<body>
		<section>
			<h1>blah blah blah</h1>
			<h2>another set of blah blah blah</h2>
		</section>
	</body>
</html>
```

we use it to align certain things and give final touches through sections.
