we use this tag to add links to our web page 

example 
```html 
<html>
	<body>
		<a href="link that you want to add">Text that will posses link on click</a>
	</body>
</html>
```

you can also convert specific texts and also images to a link , just nest it under a link tag 

### target attribute 

target attribute is used mostly to open the link in a new tab 

this is done by adding `_blank`  in target attribute 
here is the code 
```html 
<html>
	<body>
		<a href="link that you want to add" target="_blank">Text that will posses link on click</a>
	</body>
</html>
```
