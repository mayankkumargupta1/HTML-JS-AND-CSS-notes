Yes, we use image tags to add images and here is how it is done.

```html 
<html>
	<body>
		<h1>This is an example of image</h1>
		<img src="path to the image given here">
	</body>
</html>
```


### alt attribute 

alt attribute in image is used by screen readers and seen when the image fails to load 

here is how 
```html 
<html>
	<body>
		<h1>This is an example of image</h1>
		<img src="path to the image given here" alt="Image of a cute human">
	</body>
</html>
```
