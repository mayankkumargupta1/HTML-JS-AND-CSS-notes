`hr` is a html element used to add a grey line to separate html elements.

here is how it looks,
```html 
<p> some text to separate </p> 
<hr>
<p> text that is separated </p>
```

`hr` tag does not require any closing tag

the thing that it is in `css` section that it is mainly used as a styling element and not as a `html` structured data element.

lets add some style
```css
hr {
	height: 3px
}
```
